 * Makes a selector that merges a props object with a state object at a certain matching lens location,

 * If there are Region objects in the state and User object as the props that contains Regions,
 * the lens is R.lensProp('regions') and checks to see which regions of the user are active and
 * returns the regions of the state that match.
 *
 * The predicate checks properties appended to the userSettings version of the data, such as
 * checking for keys like 'isSelected' or 'willDelete' or 'willAdd'
 * @param {Function} innerJoinPedicate Predicate to determine whether each item targeted by stateLens and propLens
 * @param {Function} predicate Predicate that expects each merged value of the container of the lens
 * @param {Function} stateLens Ramda lens to winnow in on the property of the state to be merged with props and then filtered
 * @param {Function} propsLens Ramda lens to winnow in on the props to merge with the target of the state lens
 * for the state and userSettings. It's possible for a value to only exist in the state and not
 * in the userSettings (and possibly visa-versa if the user is creating something new). These will
 * be included in the merge and run through the predicate
 * @returns {Function} A selector expecting a state and props that returns the filtered merged value pointed to by the lens
 *
 * Example:
 * lens R.lensPath(['foos', 'bars'])
 * predicate value => value.isSelected
 * state: {foos: {bars: [{id: 'bar1', name: 'Bar 1'}, {id: 'bar2', name: 'Bar 2'}]}}
 * props: {foos: {bars: {bar1: {id: 'bar1', isSelected: true}, bar2: {id: 'bar2'}}}}
 * returns: {bar1: {id: 'bar1', name: 'Bar 1' isSelected: true}}

/***
 * Memomizes a function to a single argument function so that we can always NamedTupleMap for the cache.
 * In order for this to work all objects have to be flattened into one big object. This Cache won't
 * accept inner objects that have change. So three args like
 * {a: {wombat: 1, emu: 2}}, {b: {caracal: 1, serval: 2}}, 'hamster' are converted to
 * {arg1.a: {wombat: 1, emu: 2}, arg2.b: {caracal: 1, serval: 2}, arg3: 'hamster}
 * Thus it's okay for the outer wrappers to change but the inner objects must be === identical, such as the
 * womat and caracal objects.
 * We could flatten even deeper if needed but that would start having performance impacts. This assumes
 * that the outer containers might have changed through casual merging of properties but nothing internal
 * was messed with
 * @param {Function} func A function with any number and type of args
 * @returns {Function} A function that expects the same args as func
